Introduction
The main goal of the project is to develop a Social Web Application which features non-trivial usage of data through GAE Datastore. All the details like first_name, last_name, profile picture, user_id, status, time of the status posted are stored in the GAE Datastore. I used JSP, Java Servlets for main application and HTML, CSS, javascript for styling. I created a BitBucket remote repository to publish my source code.
Purpose
The purpose of the project is to learn practically how to use GAE Datastore with real-time applications by deploying the web application into Facebook through GAE and accessing GAE Datastore from the application. With this application, a user will be able to post tweets into the application, share the tweets onto his/her timeline and also can directly send a message to their friends. All the friends posted tweets in the application can be seen in Friends Page and whose tweet is viewed more times can be seen in TOP Tweets Page.
Demonstration of the Application
This project is to implement a Social Web Application which has 3 pages namely, Tweet Page, Friends Page and Top Tweets Page. It has a navigation bar along on top of all pages. 
TWEET PAGE: This is the page that presents the user with 
A) the ability to create a new tweet 
B) a SCROLLABLE list of their tweets which they can delete if they choose to post the tweet on their facebook page/timeline and send direct message to friends with their tweet.
FRIENDS PAGE: this is the page that shows all the user's friends of this app and in a scrollable list all their Friend's tweets.
TOP TWEETS PAGE: This page displays in order of the most popular Tweets based on the Friends Page visited count.
